An object-oriented enriched finite element
code that provides a robust tool for simulating fracture using an extended finite element(XFEM)computations. The features of the program include flexibility in the integration schemes (subtriangles, subquadrilaterals, independent near-tip and discontinuous quadrature rules); domain integral methods for homogeneous and bi-material interface cracks arbitrarily oriented with respect to the mesh;
geometry is described and updated by level sets, vector level sets or a standard method; standard
and enriched approximations are independent; enrichment detection schemes: topological, geometrical,
narrow-band, etc.; multi-material problem with an arbitrary number of interfaces and slip-interfaces;
non-linear material models such as J2 plasticity with linear, isotropic and kinematic hardening.
