This class implements integration rule class.\n
DESCRIPTION: \n
Stores integration points used for integration
of necesary terms (for example computation of  stiffness matrix 
or computation of element nodal force vector ) 
and it  corresponds to some local strains 
on finite element level. Finite element can have many 
integration rules corresponding to  different strains.\n
